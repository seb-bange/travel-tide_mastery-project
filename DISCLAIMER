## üí° Usage Notes

- The logic behind the perk assignment and clustering was built for simulation and learning.
- Do not use any logic, thresholds, or automation directly in a production environment without validation.
- Make sure to adapt any queries or scripts to your own data security, privacy, and performance requirements.
- Results, insights, and clusters are derived from hypothetical user behavior.
